Vim:  The .vimrc
----------------

* The `.vimrc` for you should live within your home directory.

  * With a fresh install of Vim, it might be blank or non existant, but you can
    create it there and Vim will recognize and respect it

* In it, you can set all the defaults that you want when vim loads up

  * Settings
  * Custom keybindings
  * Custom functions
  * etc.
