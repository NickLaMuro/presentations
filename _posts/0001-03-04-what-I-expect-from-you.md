What I expect from you
----------------------
* Basic Unix/Linux terminal usage
  - I don't have time to explain this
  - Tmux is not something you can use on windows, sorry.
  - (But hey, linux doesn't cost anything, plus you can use linux VM's in windows)

* SILENCE!!!

  - Nah, just kidding.
  - Questions/Critiques are welcome (and encourage).
