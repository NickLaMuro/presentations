Vim:  Splits
------------
* In Vim, you are able to 'split' the window vertically or horizontally

  * By default, it will split the current split (or window) in half and use the
    current buffer that is in the original split to display in the new split.

  * The buffers are shared between split, so you are able to switch between
    them freely.

* To create a new horizontal split, just press `Ctrl-w s`, or `:split`

* To create a new verticle split, just press `Ctrl-w v`, or `:vsplit`
