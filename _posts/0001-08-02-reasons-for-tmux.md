Tmux: Why Tmux?
---------------
* Runs on both Mac and Linux (sorry Windows)

* Runs in it's own seperate process

* Lightweight

* Customizable (or as customized a a terminal window manager can get)

* Scriptable:  You can script actions to be done in tmux like running a command
  in another window to setting up your environment on startup

* Sharable:  You can have tmux run on a shared socked that other users on the
  same machine can share

  * AKA:  Paired programming
  * With ssh:  Remote paired programming
