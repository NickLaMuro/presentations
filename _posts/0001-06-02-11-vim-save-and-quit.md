Vim:  Save/Quit
---------------
* To save (write) a file, go to command mode and type `:w`

* To quit Vim, go to command mode and type `:q`

  * This really is 'quiting' a split, but we will get into that more later

  * By Default, you are also required to save before quiting.  To override this, use `:q!`.

  * Or to make it one step, use `:wq`.
