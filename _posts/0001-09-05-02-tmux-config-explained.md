Tmux:  Configuration
--------------------

* Just like the `.vimrc`, tmux also has a config file that you can add to your
  home directory:  `.tmux.conf`

* As with the `.vimrc`, you are able to customize the controls and the look and
  feel of the screen with the `.tmux.conf`

* Another similarity is that everything you are doing in the `.tmux.conf` is
  just executing a command that you can otherwise just run using tmux's command
  mode
