What to expect from me
----------------------
* I am terrible (okay... probably 'inexperienced') at giving talks

  - so set your expectations low

* I am not going to indoctrinate you to use these tools (for the most part...)
  - I want this talk to show you why I use this setup
  - Describe pros and cons
* I am not going to bash your current setup

  - Okay, that probably isn't true
